  # In the above code, with the data set (gapminder) provided, I have created a scatter plot of the fertility vs life expectancy of various 
    continents and i have faceted it to show the comparison between the two years i.e. 1962 and 2012. This tasks covers the major topics such
    as the use of ggplot (package) for creating plots in the R studio and also covers the modifications done on the graphs which additonally covers
    the topic of faceting, formatting.

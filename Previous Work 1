# In the above task, I have created a game in which a person has to chose a door to obtain a prize
  There are three doors behind which one has a cash prize and the other two have paper each
  now the person has to choose one of the three doors. Then out of the other two doors one door is turn around
  After this the person is asked whether he wants to switch his doors or not . I have shown the chances of winning for two cases.
  One case , if he does not switch the chances of the person's winning is 1 in 3.
  Second case, if he does switch the chances of the person's winning is 2 in 3.
